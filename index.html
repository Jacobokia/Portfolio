    <h2>Job experience</h2>
    <p>Dec 2010 to date:</p>
    <p>I have been working with Civil Aviation Authority in the Airport Fire and Rescue department as a Fire fighter</p>
    <h2>Inspiration to study Programming at Moringa School</h2>
    <p> I am greatly inspired by how software developers have come up with solutions that have bridged communication in Society</p>
    <p>Some of the best examples of such  software developers is Mark Zuckerberg who came up with Facebook. </p>
    <p> I was therefore motivated by such examples of iconic software developers.</p>
    <p>When I saw an opportunity of learning how to code under a reputable school(Moringa school),I could not afford to miss it.</p>
    <p>The first week at Moringa school has been amazing already and I look forward to become the next big thing in software development.</p>
